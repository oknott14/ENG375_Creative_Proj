	Tolkien implements a complex array of languages into the Lord of the Rings. He even goes as far as to model the languages in the series after the largest modern linguistic families. In The Lhammas Tolkien describes the evolution of each language from Valerian to the present day tongues of Middle earth. Tolkien's use of sounds in the languages are often representative of the people who speak them. For example, the Elves are considered light-footed, elegant, and very beautiful people. Their language utilizes open sounds created by the vowels paired with letters like l, n, r, etc. Thus, their tongue sounds like one of the European love languages. It often flows and rhymes, which supports the Elvish tradition of being knowledgeable about lore and history - often put into verse so that it is easily remembered. On the other hand, the Dwarfish language is very consonant heavy, containing a lot of sharp and harsh sounds. This is representative of their history in mines and forges. The loud and sharp sounds mirror the noises made by their tools. The sounds in Tolkien's languages persist to the naming of characters as well. So, determining one's heritage based on their name is often easy if you know what sounds and letters are common in each language. 
	For my creative project, I wanted to create a way to determine what race and ethnicity one would associate with based on their name. To accomplish this, I used machine learning to associate any name with characters from the books and movies. First, I mapped each name from the series into a 26 dimensional vector, which allows us to calculate the distance from one character from another. So, when you enter your own name, the algorithm can recognize the characters and sounds and return the closest character, race, ethnicity, and place of residence. Using this algorithm, if you enter a name like "ulgkdzb", the algorithm will return one of the orcs, since these sounds are common in their language. On the other hand, if you enter a name like "ellendagorn", the returned name will be an Elf.
